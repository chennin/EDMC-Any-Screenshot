# Screenshot Limpet, a plugin for Elite: Dangerous Market Connector

## Beta (0.93) release

This [EDMC](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/) plugin watches an arbitrary directory, for example NVIDIA Geforce Experience's Elite: Dangerous screenshot directory, for new images, and renames them and moves them to another folder, for example your usual Elite: Dangerous screenshot directory.

One reason to use this is if you use ReShade or NVIDIA Freestyle: Hitting F10 will _not_ yield a picture that matches what you are seeing. Instead, you can hit Alt+F2 (for NVIDIA) and then this plugin will move that screenshot to be with your other screenshots or wherever you want.

**Requires EDMC 5.1.0 or above**


# Features

* Move and rename screenshots from any directory (examples: NVIDIA's, Steam's) to any other directory.

## Notes

* Default NVIDIA GeForce Experience screenshot directory: `%userprofile%\Videos\Elite Dangerous`
* Default Elite: Dangerous screenshot directory: `%userprofile%\Pictures\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous`
* For a friendlier and fancier plugin that watches ED's screenshots only, see [EDMC-Screenshot](https://github.com/NoFoolLikeOne/EDMC-Screenshot/releases)
