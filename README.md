# Alpha release

This plugin watches an arbitrary directory, for example Nvidia Geforce Experience's Elite: Dangerous screenshot directory, for new images, and renames them and moves them in to your usual Elite: Dangerous screenshot directory.

For a friendlier and fancier plugin that watches ED's screenshots only, see [EDMC-Screenshot](https://github.com/NoFoolLikeOne/EDMC-Screenshot/releases)

Default Nvidia GeForce Experience screenshot directory: `%userprofile%\Videos\Elite Dangerous`

Default Elite: Dangerous screenshot directory: `%userprofile%\Pictures\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous`
